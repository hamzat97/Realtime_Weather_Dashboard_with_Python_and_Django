# Real-time_Weather_Dashboard_with_Python_and_Django
Today, climate data monitoring represents a useful tool for planning and implementing activities in climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water resources, energy. the aim of this work is essentially to show you how to easily create a dashboard to visualize in real time the last measurements made by a weather station, using Python and Django framework. To use this work, it is necessary to insert the new measurements in the database periodically and to deploy the application in a server so that it is accessible everywhere.
